## Introduction
A note taker app that'll let you save notes.

## How it Works
You begin the app with the "Get Started" button which will direct you to another page. You can add a title and underneath begin writing anything you want. Top right youll have a "save" icon which will store your notes. The stored notes will be on the left side of the screen with a "trash" icon for deleting.
